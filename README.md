automation is fun.


## Compiling Applescript

Plaintext `.applescript` files should be compiled into binary `.scpt` files to use them happily.

My preference is just to write them in Apple's Script Editor, and compile & export as a script.

If you insist on using your own editor, compile via `osacompile -o filename.scpt filename.applescript`.


## Script Libraries

To create importable _libraries_, put them in: `~/Library/Script Libraries/`

* You may have to create that folder
* These files _must_ be compiled `.scpt` format


## iTerm2 Scripts

Put `.scpt` scripts in: `~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/Scripts/`

When you restart iTerm2 you should now see a *Scripts* menu option.

Go nuts!

## Bash Aliases

Simply put something like the following into your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias six="osascript ~/Libary/Application Support/iTerm2/Scripts/six_sessions.scpt "
```

With aliases, you can pass args to your scripts, e.g. `six 101`.

See [this example script](six_sessions/six_sessions.applescript) for more info.
